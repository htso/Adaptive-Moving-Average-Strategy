# Adaptive Moving Average as an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

Moving average is notoriously unreliable as a guide to making investment decision. Many signals generated by a moving average are false breaks that are reversed immediately, resulting in loses and causing much frustration. In this paper, I propose an unsupervised adaptive algorithm based on the concept of moving average that is provably better than any moving average system. Instead of a fixed averaging signal, Adma is a parametric model that learns from the stochastic process and follows the underlying trend. 

Learning is formulated as a constraint optimization problem that minimize the strategy's P/L. Since the objective function is non-convex and non-differentiable, the gradient does not exist and thus much of the current optimization techniques would fail. To tackle this unconventional and challenging problem, I employ three techniques

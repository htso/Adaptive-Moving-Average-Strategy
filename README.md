# ADMA : Adaptive Moving Average as an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

Moving average is notoriously unreliable as a guide to making investment decision. Many signals generated by a moving average are false breaks that are reversed immediately, resulting in loses and causing much frustration. In this paper, I propose an unsupervised adaptive algorithm based on the concept of moving average that is provably better than any moving average system. Instead of a fixed averaging signal, Adma is a parametric model that learns from the stochastic process and follows the underlying trend. 

Learning is formulated as a constraint optimization problem that minimizes the strategy's P/L. Since the objective function is non-convex and non-differentiable, the gradient does not exist and thus much of the current optimization techniques would fail. To tackle this unconventional and challenging problem, I borrow techniques from statistical physics and microbiology, using coordinated and evolving search agents to seek out local optimum.  

Applied to the benchmark S&P 500 index, Adma outperforms all the popular moving average systems not just in terms of profitability; it shows significantly better risk metrics such as volatility, maximum drawdown, and frequency of trades.  

On an out-of-sample basis, Adma with a L0-regularizer shows consistent profitable performance well into the third year after the training set ends.

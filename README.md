# Adaptive Moving Average as an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

Moving average is notoriously unreliable as a guide to making trading decision. Many signals generated by a moving average are false breaks that are reversed immediately, resulting in loses and causing much frustration. In this paper, I propose an unsupervised adaptive algorithm based on the concept of moving average that is provably better than any moving average system. Instead of an inflexible averaging signal, Adma is a parametric model that learns from the stochastic process and follows the underlying trend.
